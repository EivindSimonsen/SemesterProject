          <h2>Biology and medicine</h2>
          <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.</p>
          <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>

          <h2>Evolution</h2>
          <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?</p>
          <p>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>

          <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.</p>
          <p>From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

          <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.</p>
          <p>But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future</p>
